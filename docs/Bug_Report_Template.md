## If No Defects Found

**Statement:** "No bugs found."

**Explanation:**  
During smoke, regression, and automated testing of the Tricentis Demo Web Shop, no defects were identified. Core flows (homepage, search, add to cart, login, registration) functioned as expected. Validation behaved correctly for empty search (alert) and invalid login (error message).
